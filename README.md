# Code Refactor Starter Code
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

## Table of Contents

## Description
The purpose of this project was to introduce myself to the basics of accessible design and coding and as part of an "on-the-job ticket" or feature request challenge where I modify provided code with additional features. I began with starter code of a mockup website missing accessibility features for both users and coders. The challenge was to insert these accessibility features into the code without modifying the page's design.

## Changes
Numerous changes were made to the document:
- The page was given stronger more relevant title; 
- Images were provided short alt-text descriptions for screen-readers;
- Various non-semantic elements were swapped out for more fitting semantic elements so developers could have a better idea of the page structure at a glance;
- Comment markers were added for easier visual blocking of the code.
